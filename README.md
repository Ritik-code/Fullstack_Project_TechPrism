TechPrism

Online tech magazine is a platform for students to exhibit their talent through the tech-prism website by submitting their articles and they can also read the news about the latest technology and game. We appreciate the power of social media in this digital era. Online TechPrism magazine is a boon to students as hard copies leads to wastage of paper and are cumbersome to carry. It's the age where people prefer reading blogs and staying in touch through the internet. It provides our youngsters to learn about the latest technology.
